One of them is Lee Cooperman. The US billionaire investor and hedge fund manager says he still does not understand Bitcoin. Speaking to CNBC, he stopped just short of criticising Bitcoin, saying only that people his age are finding it difficult to understand the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency. He made it clear that he thinks it&#8217;s not in the interest of the US government to further a substitute for the dollar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI have great respect for [media mogul] Barry Diller.

I don&#8217;t know if this is a con job, but I take the easy way out. I say: \u2018If you don&#8217;t understand Bitcoin, it means you&#8217;re old. I&#8217;m 78. I&#8217;m old. I don&#8217;t understand it,\u201d Cooperman said during an interview. He added that Bitcoin \u201cdoes not make a great deal of sense\u201d and he would be very careful in dealing with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chairman of Omega Advisors, a New York-based investment advisory firm, also appeared unsure about the prospects of Bitcoin to become a global currency, asserting it was not in US interest to promote an alternative to the American dollar. He said if people are nervous about the trajectory the world is following and want to save money for the future, then gold should be their preferred choice.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cryptocurrency has been growing rapidly over the past year, but many investors are yet not sure about it.
