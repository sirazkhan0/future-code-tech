<p>The first image of a black hole was just released, and it&#8217;s being celebrated around the world as a triumph of science and more evidence of the great march of human progress. In everything being said, there are overtones of the moon landing: &#8220;One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.&#8221;</p>



<p>All of which makes sense. It&#8217;s a significant&nbsp;<a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/science/news/black-hole-image-event-horizon-telescope-m87-revealed-images-pictures-2021062">event</a>. The brilliant scientific minds who found a way to obtain the image deserve our congratulations.</p>



<p>Only half a century ago, black holes were considered, in the words of Italian physicist Carlo Rovelli, &#8220;the barely credible predictions of an esoteric theory.&#8221;</p>

<p>iPhone 13 launch event is set to be held by Apple on September 14. The invite for a virtual ‘California Streaming&#8217; event has been sent out to the media and a handful of leaks give us an idea of what devices could be launched. The iPhone 13 range is largely anticipated to be announced at the event, alongside the Apple Watch Series 7 smartwatch. Even the third generation AirPods are likely to be unveiled on Tuesday. The iPhone 13 range is likely to include four models – iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency has been growing rapidly over the past year, but many investors are yet not sure about it. One of them is Lee Cooperman. The US billionaire investor and hedge fund manager says he still does not understand Bitcoin. Speaking to CNBC, he stopped just short of criticising Bitcoin, saying only that people his age are finding it difficult to understand the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency. He made it clear that he thinks it&#8217;s not in the interest of the US government to further a substitute for the dollar.</p>



<p>“I have great respect for [media mogul] Barry Diller. And I think he was online recently and I think that he said that&nbsp;<a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/tags/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>&nbsp;was a ‘con job&#8217;. I don&#8217;t know if this is a con job, but I take the easy way out. I say: ‘If you don&#8217;t understand Bitcoin, it means you&#8217;re old. I&#8217;m 78. I&#8217;m old. I don&#8217;t understand it,” Cooperman said during an interview. He added that Bitcoin “does not make a great deal of sense” and he would be very careful in dealing with it.</p>



<p>The chairman of Omega Advisors, a New York-based investment advisory firm, also appeared unsure about the prospects of Bitcoin to become a global currency, asserting it was not in US interest to promote an alternative to the American dollar. He said if people are nervous about the trajectory the world is following and want to save money for the future, then gold should be their preferred choice.</p>

<p>HBO Max, the over-the-top (OTT) streaming service that specifically offers HBO content alongside originals, TV shows, and Hollywood movies, is likely to enter India soon. While the exact launch details are yet to be revealed, HBO Max&#8217;s plan details for the Indian market have surfaced online. The streaming service is said to be available in three different tiers, starting at Rs. 69 per month. HBO Max would compete against the likes of Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ Hotstar, and Netflix that are already available in the country with catalogues offering international and local content.</p>



<p>Telecom-focussed site OnlyTech has&nbsp;<a href="https://onlytech.com/exclusive-hbo-max-plan-details-leaked-ahead-of-indian-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;the India plan details of&nbsp;<a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/tags/hbo-max">HBO Max</a>. The plans are said to be shared among a group of users under an online pre-launch survey conducted by market research firm Nepa.</p>



<p>[<strong>Update, September 8, 9:30am:</strong>&nbsp;HBO Max confirmed that it carried out this survey, but said that it doesn&#8217;t indicate what the final plans will be. A spokesperson told Gadgets 360, “We routinely conduct market research with consumers in countries around the world that test a wide range of possible offers and price points for our services. Those being reported that suggest a future launch of HBO Max in India are amongst many being tested and evaluated and do not reflect any current plans.”]</p>

<p>Shiba Inu, the cryptocurrency which made its debut last year, shares some similarities with Dogecoin, including the fact that they are both based on popular memes. But those similarities did not stop SHIB from billing itself in the crypto market as “Dogecoin killer.” It has been somewhat successful in stealing the thunder from Dogecoin, but it does not appear to have made a big dent yet. Trading at a fraction of a penny, it is far behind Dogecoin, which was trading at $0.24 (roughly Rs. 18) Saturday morning (September 11), according to CoinMarketCap.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://pricee.com/api/redirect/t.php?from=gadgets360&amp;redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcoinmarketcap.com%2Fcurrencies%2Fshiba-inu%2F">market research website&#8217;s data</a>&nbsp;showed that&nbsp;<a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/tags/shiba-inu">SHIB</a>&nbsp;has been highly volatile over the past one month. It remained above $0.0000080 (roughly Rs. 0.00059) until August 25 and then began sliding, hitting a bottom of $0.0000056 (roughly Rs. 0.00041) by September 8. It recovered from that low and is now trading around $0.0000070 (roughly Rs 0.00051). Check out the current&nbsp;<a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/finance/shiba-inu-price-in-india-today-inr">Shiba Inu Price in India here</a>.</p>



<p>In comparison,&nbsp;<a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/tags/dogecoin">DOGE</a>&nbsp;had hit a high of $0.35 (roughly Rs. 25.73) on August 16. For a week after that, it remained above the $0.30 (roughly Rs. 22.060) mark and slid below it on August 24. Dogecoin began losing value earlier this week, coinciding with<a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/bitcoin-price-el-salvador-cryptocurrency-president-nayib-bukele-400-btc-buy-own-200-tranches-2532270">&nbsp;El Salvador&#8217;s adoption of Bitcoin</a>&nbsp;as legal tender and the hiccups the rollout faced. As of September 11 (1:15pm IST),&nbsp;<a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/finance/dogecoin-price-in-india-today-inr">Dogecoin price in India</a>&nbsp;stood at Rs. 19.9.</p>

<p>The eternal question lurking in the minds of every space enthusiast is — does life exist outside Earth? Despite numerous space expeditions, we have been unable to find any trace of life outside our planet so far. However, every once in a while we hear about a UFO seen in some part of the world. Most of the time, these sightings turn out to be false alarms. And others remain a mystery. Considering that the universe is infinite, we have barely scratched the surface. So the possibility of finding extraterrestrial life is wide open. A NASA scientist has tried to address questions about aliens and whether they exist.</p>



<p>In a video on&nbsp;<a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/tags/nasa">NASA&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;Instagram page, Dr. Lindsay Hays, an astrobiology expert, says this is a really interesting question — one that scientists have been trying to understand and explore for a really long time. Still, they have not been able to discover life on any other planet.</p>
